================
1. To make this script work you will have to create a app in twitter and get the API information.
2. Go to ajax/getFromTwitter.php and look for this lines 

$consumerKey = 'Your Consumer Key';
$consumerSecret = 'Your Consumer Secret key';
$accessToken = 'App Access Token';
$accessTokenSecret = 'App Access Token Secret';


3. Use your own API information and save it.
4. Please don't forget to put this whole script (make a directory "twittter") on your app root directory.
